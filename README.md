The Twenty One file is a game project where i've made an interactive casino. The Player can choose how much money they start with, how much to bet, when to hold, and when to hit. The plyer can also choose to walk away or continue that game. I've added some exception handling as well to help prevent cheating, and also some formating exceptions in case a player chooses the the wrong formats to enter into the game. 

In my student management MVC i've added features to add and view student profiles as well as adding the capabilities of having the MVC to communicate with a local database.
